## Code

This app was originally generated from TEI Publisher 5.0.0 and slightly modified to:

* adjust indexes and facet definitions to the structure of the letters
* change filter and search options to match the letters
* apply a fancier, more playful design to `index.html` and `templates/pages/vangogh.html`

No other changes were necessary. All the components used are already provided by TEI Publisher.
